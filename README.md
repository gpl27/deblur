# Implementation of `High-Quality Motion Deblurring from a Single Image (SIGGRAPH 2008)`

This repository refers to a project for the course INF01046 - Image Processing Fundamentals at [INF](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/en) in [UFRGS](http://www.ufrgs.br/ufrgs/inicial).

## Brief Documentation

- **blind/** - contains some images generated from our blind deconvolution
- **non-blind/** - contains some images generated from our non-blind deconvolution
- **examples/** - contains a few examples of blurred images and their respective blurred kernels
- **fails/** - contains some fails generated during work
- **convolve.py** - contains the methods related to convolution
- **deblur.py** - contains the methods to perform the deconvolution
- **helpers.py** - contains some methods for reading images and kernels
- **main.py** - performs the algorithm

## About

The main goal of this project was to compare two data structures covered during the course: the Binary Search Tree (BST) and the AVL Tree. Our benchmark was based on insertions and searches using both ordered and unordered databases. Python was used for creating the databases and for data analysis, while C was used to create and manipulate the structures.
